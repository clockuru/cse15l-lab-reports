# This is Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)

For **all 9 examples** below, the absolute path to the working directory is `C:/Users/inclo/Documents/CSE15L/lecture1`.

# `cd`
1. "Share an example of using the command with *no* arguments." <br/>
```
inclo@landons-laptop MINGW64 ~/Documents/CSE15L/lecture1 (main)
$ cd

inclo@landons-laptop MINGW64 ~
```
I got this output because without any arguments, `cd` goes back to the top of my User directory, at `C:/Users/inclo/`. <br/>
This output is not an error, since the command had the expected output, which was to change the directory. <br/>
2. "Share an example of using the command with a path to a *directory* as an argument." <br/>
This text is here as a test and placeholder.
3. "Share an example of using the command with a path to a *file* as an argument." <br/>
This text is here as a test and placeholder.
