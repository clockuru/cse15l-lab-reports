# This is my way of testing markdown.
There are *many* different ways to format text using **markdown**, such as...
1. Making text bold with `**_____**`
2. Italicizing text with `*_____*`
3. Making a heading with either `# _____` or `## _____`
4. Inlining code with `backticks on either side of the text`
5. Creating a horizontal rule with `---`
6. And more!

There are still other ways to use markdown, including...
- Embedding links with `[_____](<Insert website link here>)`
- Embedding images with `![Image](<Insert image link here>)`
- Creating a blockquote with `> _____`
- Creating code blocks by using `3 backticks` or `4 indent spaces`
