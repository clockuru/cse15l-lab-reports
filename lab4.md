# This is Lab Report 4 - Vim (Week 7)

## 4. Log into ieng6

2. `ssh<space>lacannon@ieng6.ucsd.edu<enter>`<br/>
3. I used the `ssh` command in order to enter my user on ieng6 to sign in to. I typed out the full command and pressed `<enter>` because I began this portion with a fresh terminal, meaning that there was no command history for me to save keypresses with.<br/>
## 5. Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account (using the `SSH` URL)

2. `git<space>clone<space><ctrl + v><enter>`<br/>
3. I typed out the majority of the `git clone` command myself, though I copy and pasted the `SSH` URL for my fork with `<ctrl + v>`, as it would be tedious and time-consuming to type it out normally.<br/>
## 6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail

2. `cd<space>l<tab><enter>` , `bash<space>t<tab><enter>`<br/>
3. For my first set of keypresses, I changed directory into `lab7/` in order to prevent having to type out that directory for the rest of my commands. Additioanlly, I took advantage of `<tab>` by not having any other directories starting with 'L', meaning that I could directly enter the directory with just an 'L' and a `<tab>`. The same applies to the second set of keypresses, where `test.sh` is the only file starting with a 'T'. After typing out the filename, I ran `test.sh` in order to demonstrate that the tests fail.<br/>
## 7. Edit the code to fix the failing test
